## Introduction

Done isn't just another message queue service; it's a celebration of simplicity and open-source ingenuity. It's perfect for those who like their tech like they like their coffee: strong, straightforward, and capable of keeping you up at night (in a good way, we promise!).

Embrace the open-source simplicity with Done. Queue up, have fun, and get it done! 

- üì° RESTful API, Joyful You: Manage your queues with a RESTful API that's as simple as a light switch ‚Äì on, off, and awesome.
- üß∞ No-Frills, All Thrills: We've cut the fluff, leaving you with a lean, mean, message-queuing machine.
- ü¶ï Deno-Deploy-Powered: With its foundation in Deno, Done is as awesome as a dinosaur rocking shades. That's right, we're keeping it that cool ;)

## Storage

Done supports two storage backends, each with distinct strengths:

#### üèÜ **Turso (Recommended for Production)**

**Why Turso?** When you're managing data relationships, dependencies, and complex queries, SQL is your best friend. Turso gives you the power of SQLite with global distribution - perfect for applications that need to scale and manage interconnected data efficiently.

- **Local Development**: Use `:memory:` for testing or `file:local.db` for persistent local development
- **Production**: Deploy to Turso's global edge network with automatic replication
- **Data Management**: Full SQL capabilities for complex queries, relationships, and data integrity
- **Scalability**: Built for production workloads with edge distribution
- **Migration Support**: Built-in schema migrations for evolving your data structure

```bash
# Recommended production setup
STORAGE_TYPE=TURSO
TURSO_DB_URL=https://your-db.turso.io
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token

# Local development options
TURSO_DB_URL=:memory:           # For testing
TURSO_DB_URL=file:local.db      # For persistent local dev
```

#### ‚ö° **Deno KV (Built-in Simplicity)**

**When to use KV?** Perfect for simple use cases where you need zero setup and minimal configuration. KV excels at key-value operations but isn't designed for managing complex data relationships or dependencies.

- **Zero Setup**: Works out of the box with Deno Deploy
- **Simple Operations**: Great for basic CRUD operations
- **Built-in**: No external dependencies required
- **Limitations**: Not ideal for complex data relationships or advanced querying

```bash
# Simple setup - works immediately
STORAGE_TYPE=KV  # This is the fallback default
```

#### ü§î **Which Should You Choose?**

- **Choose Turso** if you're building a production application, need data relationships, want SQL querying power, or plan to scale beyond basic message queuing
- **Choose KV** if you want absolute simplicity, are prototyping, or have minimal data management needs

**Our Recommendation**: Start with Turso for any serious project. The migration system and SQL capabilities will serve you well as your application grows. KV is fantastic for getting started quickly, but Turso provides the foundation for long-term success.

To configure your storage backend:

```bash
# Set your preferred storage type
STORAGE_TYPE=TURSO  # or 'KV' for simplicity

# Required for Turso (production)
TURSO_DB_URL=https://your-db.turso.io
TURSO_DB_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Turso Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Turso CLI
curl -sSfL https://get.tur.so/install.sh | bash

# Create your database
turso db create done-db

# Get your database URL and auth token
turso db show done-db --url
turso db tokens create done-db
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file for development:

```bash
# Storage configuration (recommended)
STORAGE_TYPE=TURSO
TURSO_DB_URL=:memory:  # or your Turso URL for production
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token-here

# Authentication
AUTH_TOKEN=your-secret-auth-token

# Optional: Enable detailed logging
ENABLE_LOGS=true
```

### 3. Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dnl-fm/done.git
cd done

# Run with environment file
deno task dev
```

### 4. Test Your Setup

```bash
# Send a test message
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3001/v1/https://httpbin.org/post' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your-secret-auth-token' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Done-Delay: 10s' \
  -d '{"message": "Hello from Done!"}'
```

## Messages

### Absolute Delay

```ts
await fetch('https://your-done-host.com/http://your-callback-url.com/some-path/123456789', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ******',
    'Done-Not-Before': 1700902800, // 2023-11-25T09:00:00Z
    'Content-type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({name: 'Foo Bar', email: 'foo@bar.com'})
});
```
__Expected response__
You will receive a message-id as well as the set date of callback.

```ts
201 Created

{
  "id": "msg_ytc6tbklsjmurie7ppxtqfnreh",
  "publish_at": "2023-11-25T09:00:00Z"
}
```
__Expected callback at `2023-11-25T09:00:00Z`__
Your actual callback message.

```ts
POST http://your-callback-url.com/some-path/123456789
done-message-id: msg_ytc6tbklsjmurie7ppxtqfnreh
done-status: deliver
done-retried: 0
user-agent: Done Light

{
  "name": "Foo Bar",
  "email": "foo@bar.com"
}
```

### Relative Delay

You sent a request at `2023-11-25T09:00:00Z`.

```ts
await fetch('https://your-done-host.com/http://your-callback-url.com/some-path/123456789', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ******',
    'Done-Delay': '5m', // in 5 minutes
    'Content-type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({name: 'Foo Bar', email: 'foo@bar.com'})
});
```
__Expected response__
You will receive a message-id as well as the calculated date of callback.

```ts
201 Created

{
  "id": "msg_ytc6tbklsjmurie7ppxtqfnreh",
  "publish_at": "2023-11-25T09:05:00Z"
}
```
__Expected callback at `2023-11-25T09:05:00Z`__
Your actual callback message.

```ts
POST http://your-callback-url.com/some-path/123456789
done-message-id: msg_ytc6tbklsjmurie7ppxtqfnreh
done-status: deliver
done-retried: 0
user-agent: Done Light

{
  "name": "Foo Bar",
  "email": "foo@bar.com"
}
```
__Delay format__

The format for this type of delay is `<number><unit>`. Valid units are:

- seconds (s)
- minutes (m)
- hours (h)
- days (d)

_Some delay examples:_

- `10s` (enough to catch your breath),
- `5m` (perfect for a quick coffee),
- `20m` (ideal for a power nap),
- `2h` (great for binge-watching your favorite show),
- `14d` (for those who plan way ahead).

### Immediate messages

No `Delay` header? No delay! Done will callback immediately as it receives the message. You sent a request at `2023-11-25T09:00:00Z`.

```ts
await fetch('https://your-done-host.com/http://your-callback-url.com/some-path/123456789', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer ******'}
});
```

__Expected response__
You will receive a message-id as well as the calculated date of callback.

```ts
201 Created

{
  "id": "msg_ytc6tbklsjmurie7ppxtqfnreh",
  "publish_at": "2023-11-25T09:00:00Z"
}
```
__Expected callback immediate after `2023-11-25T09:00:00Z`__
Your actual callback message.

```ts
POST http://your-callback-url.com/some-path/123456789
done-message-id: msg_ytc6tbklsjmurie7ppxtqfnreh
done-status: deliver
done-retried: 0
user-agent: Done Light
```

### Callback headers

You can attach callback headers which Done will integrate when calling you back. Just flag these with `Done-`.

```ts
// callback headers

await fetch('https://your-done-host.com/http://your-callback-url.com/some-path/123456789', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ******',
    'Content-type': 'application/json',
    'Done-Authorization': 'Bearer *********'
    'Done-Foo': 'bar',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({name: 'Foo Bar', email: 'foo@bar.com'})
});
```
__Expected callback message__

```ts
POST http://your-callback-url.com/some-path/123456789
Authorization: Bearer *********
foo: bar
done-message-id: msg_ytc6tbklsjmurie7ppxtqfnreh
done-status: deliver
done-retried: 0
user-agent: Done Light

{
  "name": "Foo Bar",
  "email": "foo@bar.com"
}
```

### Retries and Failure-Callback

By default Done will try 3 times to call the specified message url. If that does not work and the message included a `Done-Failure-Callback`-header it will try to send the message to that given URL before moving it to the `Dead Letter Queue`.

```ts
await fetch('https://your-done-host.com/http://your-callback-url.com/some-path/123456789', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ******',
    'Content-type': 'application/json',
    'Done-Failure-Callback': 'http://your-callback-url.com/failure/123456789',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({name: 'Foo Bar', email: 'foo@bar.com'})
});
```

## Setup on Deno Deploy

### 1. Create Your Deno Deploy Project

Setup a project over at [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy). You can either:
- Deploy Done directly by uploading the code
- Connect it with your GitHub repository for automatic deployments (recommended)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

In your Deno Deploy project settings, add these environment variables:

#### Required Variables
```bash
# Authentication (required)
AUTH_TOKEN=your-super-secret-auth-token

# Storage type (recommended: Turso)
STORAGE_TYPE=TURSO

# For Turso storage (recommended for production)
TURSO_DB_URL=https://your-db.turso.io
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-turso-auth-token
```

#### Optional Variables
```bash
# Enable detailed logging (saves KV writes if using KV storage)
ENABLE_LOGS=true

# Only if using KV storage (not recommended for production)
STORAGE_TYPE=KV  # Fallback option
```

### 3. Turso Production Setup

For production deployments with Turso:

1. **Create a production database**:
   ```bash
   turso db create done-production
   ```

2. **Get your production URL and token**:
   ```bash
   turso db show done-production --url
   turso db tokens create done-production
   ```

3. **Set up replica locations** (optional, but recommended):
   ```bash
   turso db replicate done-production --location fra
   turso db replicate done-production --location nrt
   ```

4. **Add the credentials to Deno Deploy environment variables**

### 4. Deploy and Test

Once deployed, test your setup:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://your-deploy.deno.dev/v1/https://httpbin.org/post' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your-super-secret-auth-token' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Done-Delay: 30s' \
  -d '{"message": "Hello from production!"}'
```

**Pro tip**: Use the Bruno collection in `docs/bruno-collection/` to test all endpoints systematically! üöÄ

With Turso, you get a globally distributed, production-ready setup that scales with your needs. Like having a perfectly organized digital infrastructure that works worldwide! üåç

## What about Deno's native Queue?

[Deno's native queue](https://deno.com/blog/queues) is super handy for instant action in your Deno Deploy projects, like firing emails or sending requests on the fly. But when it comes to tracking those enqueued little critters, it's like herding cats. You'd have to play double duty, shuffling each message into a KV store and keeping tabs on their every move. Thinking of delaying a message? You've got a week, max. That's it.

Enter Done - your new best bud in the messaging realm. This isn't just another tool; it's a developer's dream sidekick _\*cough\*_. Picture it stepping out of Deno's shadow, ready to serve any app, anywhere. Done keeps an eagle eye on all messages and their states, making callbacks with custom headers to any external service like it's no big deal.

And when it comes to delays, Done laughs in the face of 7-day limits. Whether you're plotting to send a "see you in two months" email or scheduling an invoice way down the line, Done's your time-traveling ally. No delay cap, just boundless possibilities.

So, here's the deal: Done is unapologetically developer-friendly. No complicated setups, no riddles to solve. It's as transparent and straightforward as it gets. Just the way you like it.

__P.S. Big shoutout to the Deno team! Without Deno Queues and Deno KV, this tool would've been a no-go. Huge thanks for their fantastic work ‚Äì couldn't have done it without them!__ üôåü¶ï

## Credits

Done is inspired by [Upstash's Qstash](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/overall/getstarted) message queue. It's great but I thought, 'Nice, but how about a bit more love?' You know, like a unicorn in a world of horses. So, I added open source, some sprinkle of developer-friendly magic as well as home-brewability.

While Qstash is the reliable sedan, Done is the fun convertible with the top down, zooming past limitations and honking with joy at every turn!
