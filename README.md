## Features

### Absolute Delay

```ts
await fetch('https://your-done-host.com/http://your-callback-url.com/some-path/123456789', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ******',
    'Done-Not-Before': 1700902800, // 2023-11-25T09:00:00Z
    'Content-type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({name: 'Foo Bar', email: 'foo@bar.com'})
});
```
__Expected response__
You will receive a message-id as well as the set date of callback.

```ts
201 Created

{
  "id": "msg_ytc6tbklsjmurie7ppxtqfnreh",
  "publishAt": "2023-11-25T09:00:00Z"
}
```
__Expected callback at `2023-11-25T09:00:00Z`__
Your actual callback message.

```ts
POST http://your-callback-url.com/some-path/123456789
done-message-id: msg_ytc6tbklsjmurie7ppxtqfnreh
done-status: deliver
done-retried: 0
user-agent: Done Light

{
  "name": "Foo Bar",
  "email": "foo@bar.com"
}
```

### Relative Delay

You sent a request at `2023-11-25T09:00:00Z`.

```ts
await fetch('https://your-done-host.com/http://your-callback-url.com/some-path/123456789', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ******',
    'Done-Delay': '5m', // in 5 minutes
    'Content-type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({name: 'Foo Bar', email: 'foo@bar.com'})
});
```
__Expected response__
You will receive a message-id as well as the calculated date of callback.

```ts
201 Created

{
  "id": "msg_ytc6tbklsjmurie7ppxtqfnreh",
  "publishAt": "2023-11-25T09:05:00Z"
}
```
__Expected callback at `2023-11-25T09:05:00Z`__
Your actual callback message.

```ts
POST http://your-callback-url.com/some-path/123456789
done-message-id: msg_ytc6tbklsjmurie7ppxtqfnreh
done-status: deliver
done-retried: 0
user-agent: Done Light

{
  "name": "Foo Bar",
  "email": "foo@bar.com"
}
```
__Delay format__

The format for this type of delay is `<number><unit>`. Valid units are:

- seconds (s)
- minutes (m)
- hours (h)
- days (d)

_Some delay examples:_

- `10s` (enough to catch your breath),
- `5m` (perfect for a quick coffee),
- `20m` (ideal for a power nap),
- `2h` (great for binge-watching your favorite show),
- `14d` (for those who plan way ahead).

### Immediate messages

No `Delay` header? No delay! Done will callback immediately as it receives the message. You sent a request at `2023-11-25T09:00:00Z`.

```ts
await fetch('https://your-done-host.com/http://your-callback-url.com/some-path/123456789', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer ******'}
});
```

__Expected response__
You will receive a message-id as well as the calculated date of callback.

```ts
201 Created

{
  "id": "msg_ytc6tbklsjmurie7ppxtqfnreh",
  "publishAt": "2023-11-25T09:00:00Z"
}
```
__Expected callback immediate after `2023-11-25T09:00:00Z`__
Your actual callback message.

```ts
POST http://your-callback-url.com/some-path/123456789
done-message-id: msg_ytc6tbklsjmurie7ppxtqfnreh
done-status: deliver
done-retried: 0
user-agent: Done Light
```

### Callback headers

You can attach callback headers which Done will integrate when calling you back. Just flag these with `Done-`.

```ts
// callback headers

await fetch('https://your-done-host.com/http://your-callback-url.com/some-path/123456789', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ******',
    'Content-type': 'application/json',
    'Done-Authorization': 'Bearer *********'
    'Done-Foo': 'bar',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({name: 'Foo Bar', email: 'foo@bar.com'})
});
```
__Expected callback message__

```ts
POST http://your-callback-url.com/some-path/123456789
Authorization: Bearer *********
foo: bar
done-message-id: msg_ytc6tbklsjmurie7ppxtqfnreh
done-status: deliver
done-retried: 0
user-agent: Done Light

{
  "name": "Foo Bar",
  "email": "foo@bar.com"
}
```

### Retries and Failure-Callback

By default Done will try 3 times to call the specified message url. If that does not work and the message included a `Done-Failure-Callback`-header it will try to send the message to that given URL before moving it to the `Dead Letter Queue`.

```ts
await fetch('https://your-done-host.com/http://your-callback-url.com/some-path/123456789', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ******',
    'Content-type': 'application/json',
    'Done-Failure-Callback': 'http://your-callback-url.com/failure/123456789',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({name: 'Foo Bar', email: 'foo@bar.com'})
});
```

## Setup on Deno Deploy

All you need is an environment variable `AUTH_TOKEN`. _Done_ checks your authorization bearer token against that env variable.


## API Endpoints

There are a couple of API endpoints defined as a [bruno collection](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno).

The collection can be [found here](docs/bruno-collection/).


## Credits

Done is inspired by [Upstash's Qstash](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/overall/getstarted) message queue. It's great but I thought, 'Nice, but how about a bit more love?' You know, like a unicorn in a world of horses. So, I added open source, some sprinkle of developer-friendly magic as well as home-brewability.

While Qstash is the reliable sedan, Done is the fun convertible with the top down, zooming past limitations and honking with joy at every turn!
